# Trackmania Turbo

Adds support for load removal and autosplitting for Trackmania Turbo on PC (Ubisoft Connect).

## Features

- IGT reflects the race time down to hundreds. Thousandths are disregarded to keep compatibility with console versions.
- Starts after the countdown on the first map played
- Splits on map finish
- Resets when restarting the first map played

## Installation

- In LiveSplit, right-click and go to "Edit Splits..."
- Click the "Activate" button to download and enable the script

Once activated, start/split/reset functionality can be toggled in the settings.

Then, make sure to compare against "Game Time" in LiveSplit.

## Contact

Let me know if there are any problems regarding the script or if you have any feature requests!

## Known problems

The pointer path for the map name is not always reliable. This causes the autosplitter to sometimes not start a run when it should, and map names in the log may be incorrect.

It's also not possible to distinguish between campaign and user-made tracks as we don't have information about the map author.
